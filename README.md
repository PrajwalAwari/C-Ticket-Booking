 # C-Ticket-Booking
This project is a simple Movie Ticket Booking System implemented in C. It allows users to enter details about a movie, select a seating circle, and calculates the ticket cost based on the selected category and circle. The program is designed to demonstrate fundamental C programming concepts.

# Features
User -Friendly Interface: Easy to enter input info about movie.
Dynamic Ticket Pricing: Calculates ticket costs based on the selected movie category (2D or 3D) and seating circle (gold or silver).
Input Validation: Checks for valid user input and provides error messages for invalid selections, enhancing user experience.

# C Language Concepts Used
Structures: Defines a custom data type (Movie) to group related data.
Functions: Implements multiple functions to organize code and improve maintainability.
Input/Output: Uses standard input and output functions (printf, scanf, gets) for user interaction.
Control Flow: Employs conditional statements (if, else if, else) to handle different scenarios based on user input.
String Handling: Utilizes string comparison functions (strcmp) to compare user input with predefined values.
Static Variables: Implements static variables in functions to maintain state across calls.
Pointers: Uses pointers in function parameters to manipulate data directly.
Return Values: Functions return values to indicate success or failure, allowing for effective error handling

# Usage
1.Clone the Repository.
2.Compile the Code: Use a C compiler to compile the C files.
3.Run the Program: Execute the compiled program.
4.Follow the Prompts: Enter the required movie details, select a seating circle, and receive the calculated ticket cost.
